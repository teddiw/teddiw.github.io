### Bio

Hi! I'm Theodora Worledge, a computer science PhD student at Stanford advised by the wonderful [Carlos Guestrin](https://guestrin.su.domains/). I am supported by the [NSF GRFP Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

I care about making ML models reliable and trustworthy. I'm particularly interested in equipping users with interpretability tools to verify outputs as model capabilities scale. Recently, I've been thinking about attributions for language model outputs.

Previously, I graduated with a BA in computer science from UC Berkeley. I am very fortunate to have worked with [Esther Rolf](https://www.estherrolf.com/) and [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/) during my time there.

I often go by Teddi :)
